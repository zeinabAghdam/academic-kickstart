Hi, 

First of all, you can call me ***Sahar*** if you wish. Since August 2019, I am a PostDoc student at **[Aarhus University](https://cs.au.dk/da/)**, institute of Datalogi in Denmark. I received my PhD in the field of Computational Neuroscience from the faculty of Medicine at Saarland University in Oct 2019 **[SNNU](http://www.snnu.uni-saarland.de/)**. 

My current research at Aarhus University centers around analysis of healthcare data and AI (Learn more about the projects in [HealthD360](https://healthd360.dk/)). In particular, I am interested in the role of AI in prevention of Diabetic Foot Ulcer and Amputation. In my first project, I studied how general socio-economical and medical history of diabetic patients can be used to stratify the population of patients with a high risk of developing DFU/amputation. This is in particular helpful and meaningful given the available centralized registry information of all citizen in Denmark, but not enough for designing precise predictive systems. 

Aside from that, I love traveling (not in the middle of a pandemic though), baking, painting and recently an interest in perfumery. You may hear from a hobby project of mine soon :). 

I am interested in collaborating in fields of Data science, Healthcare and AI.
