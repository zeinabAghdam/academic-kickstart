title: Study of Foot Ulcer and Amputation in HealthD360
date: 2021-01-01T15:34:42.340Z
summary: In this project we study the risk factors for developing diabetic foot
  ulcer and amputation in patients with diabetes. The goal is to design
  predictive systems which is able to predict the occurrence of such incidents
  in patients.

As part of the HealthD360 project we aim to develop a system that is able to automatically analyze the state of
wounds for patients susuffering from DFU based on image data. We want to enable patients to take pictures using
a mobile application which is being developed by other project partners in the HealthD360 project. Based on the
image types (thermal or normal RGB), I would like to explore different techniques for wound area estimation
and its state using deep learning approaches.

In addition to images, we use national registry of patients with diabetes to investigate different social-economic factors that increase the risk of DFU and amputation. In our first study we assessed the risk of DFU and amputation of more than two hundred thousand patients with diabetes in denmark using survival analysis and ML model. The results are under publication (accepted) in the Frontiers, journal of dermatology.
