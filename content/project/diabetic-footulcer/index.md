title: "Amputation risk in patients with Type 2 Diabetes "
date: 2021-01-01T15:34:42.340Z
summary: In this project we study the risk factors for developing diabetic foot
  ulcer and amputation in patients with diabetes. The goal is to design
  predictive systems which is able to predict the occurrence of such incidents
  in patients.

As part of HealthD360, one of the goals is to create a model based on different data modalities (EHR, images, self-tracking data, etc.) to predict the risk of amputation in patients with diabetes. We have access to registry information of more than 240,000 patients with diabetes in Denmark. In our first study we used the available registry data and applied a risk analysis study to determine factors that increase the risk of amputation in patients with diabetes. National registry information have their own limitations and are not sufficient for such predictions. In the next phase of this project, we hope to get access to more data rsources (images, EHR) for better and accurate predictive models for prediction of amputation risk. [`Check`](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2020.601602/full) our initial results in Frontiers, journal of dermatology where we employ ML models and survival analysis to study the risk of amputation. 

The second ongoing study is about the effect of GLP-1 receptor agonist and whether prolonged and continuouse intake of the medication could provide a protective effect against amputation in patients with type 2 diabetes.
