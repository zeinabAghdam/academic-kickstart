List of projects that I am working on:

**1- Detection of Diabetic Foot Ulcer and Amputation using Deep learning**

One of the goals of the HealthD360 project is to develop a system for automatically analyzing the state of
wounds for patients suffering from DFU based on image data. We want to enable patients to take pictures using
a mobile application which is being developed by other project partners in the HealthD360 project. Based on the
image types (thermal or normal RGB), I would like to explore different techniques for wound area estimation
and its state using deep learning approaches.

In addition to images, we use national registry of patients with diabetes to investigate different social-economic factors that increase the risk of DFU and amputation. In our first study we assessed the risk of DFU and amputation of more than two hundred thousand patients with diabetes in denmark using survival analysis and ML model. Publication is under production in Frontiers, journal of dermatology. 



**2- Prediction of Obesity in Adulthood Based on Data from Childhood**

**3- Measuring the Level of Selective Attention Using Instantaneouse Phase Data ( Collaboration with SNNU)**
